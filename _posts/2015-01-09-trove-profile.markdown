        The "before"

        Research/Approach:
        After reading a study from <a href="http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-onboarding/">Ghost</a> about updating profiles. And watching countless User Testing (link)videos. Researching the case studies of a few major brands updating their profiles (including <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/designing-the-new-twitter-profiles">Twitter</a>), we went to work sketching and ideas. We made a few basic assumptions about what would be valuable to support on a profile and how to display the existing data we had on a user to support the second assumption about the what to include.

        Details (2 mobile mocks, side-by-side)


        Then I'll begin pixel-perfect mock ups of the final designs. After the designs are reviewed by stakeholders, they are split into tickets and I'll generate a focused batch of mockup files for each ticket that way the engineer can just grab exactly what they need and don't have to dig at all.

        As a fun game try making the first one look filled in like the second prototype.

    <div class="content-column">

        Here's a bonus. It's a settings page I made to go with the new profile page. It was eventually scrapped based on the decision to use engineering resourses where there's more traffic. But this design solved a few problems we have on the current settings pages dealing with different input types that require different saving paradigms.

        <p>It's a clickable prototype too, so feel free to play around and check out the different input types and save structure. </p>
