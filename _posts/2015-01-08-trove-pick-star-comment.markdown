        Finding and curating relevant news content is hard.

        <p>Product strategy: We really need to get some more engagement and interactivity on the site. After folks read an article, there's no way to allow folks to engage with the story, to grow an audience or to curate content.</p>

        <p>There's no shortage of inspiration on the web for starring or liking interactions. We looked at dozens of competitors before sketching out possible solutions. </p>

        This project was a massive undertaking that spanned several months. Wireframes for this project went through many rounds of executive stakeholder review before design and prototyping phases.

        <p>In this project, "Picking" was established as a "curation action". When a user picked an article, they were essentially adding it to a list that other users could follow. Some of the key decisions were how to invoke the pick action. We went with a modal so that users could focus on the task at hand. Also a modal worked well because it can pop on any page without disturbing the content beneath the modal.</p>

        <p>This project plan was so large that we started by rethinking what would be the best card reading experience would be for the user. We were looking to balance information density and beautiful calming news reader. Below is a few of my explorations. We eventually stuck with the card layout second from the left. </p>

        </a></p>

        <p>Below is a screenshot of the final round of mobile wireframes. The key flows outlined are the Pick flow, the trove creation flow from a pick, and the trove/article views after a pick.</p>

        <p>Next I moved into the visual design phase. Would take a little while to write up, but I would love to talk about all the little design decisions that went into this if you're interested. Shoot me an <a href="mailto:christopherazar@gmail.com">email</a>. </p>

        I handed off a few polished micro-interactions as prototypes in the early stages of development. Below is a CSS image sprite button. It animates through 14 steps over a desired animation time to create the animated effect. Take a look at the CSS tab for the magic.
