        Users: I would really love if there was a way to let someone know I liked thier pick! or say something about the article. Also, what does the "Picking" action even do?

        <p>Product/Biz: We really need to get some more engagement on the site. There's articles, but there's nothng after that for them to do with the articles.</p>

        Wireframes for this project went through 19 rounds of feedback before the executive and engineering teams were satisfied before the mockup and prototyping phases.

        <p>This was also before Sketch had implemented the symbols funtionality, which was a welcome addition later down the road.</p>

        <p>This project plan was so large that we started by rethinking what would be the best card reading experience would be for the user. We were looking to balance information density and beautiful calming news reader.</p>
