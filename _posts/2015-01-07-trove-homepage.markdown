Role:
Problem: "Users: Seems like a cool app. What do we do next?"
        "Product/Biz: users don't know what they need to do next"
Research/Approach: Make a homepage that's dynamic and personalized to the user and thier place in our flow/funnel.
   <p>There are a few different types of users we wanted to account for and they closely follow the legendayry 90-9-1% internet rule. Our lurkers, followers/readers and our curators all need a customized interface so we can guide them on "what to do next."</p>
