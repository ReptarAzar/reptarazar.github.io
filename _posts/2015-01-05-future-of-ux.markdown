## Teaching to the Future UX

... and other lessons from a UX Designer in Residence at General Assembly.

After work for several weeks this past Summer I'd gather and conjure predictions of a magical future and technology's role in that sweet future. This post includes those slides for you to thumb through. It was a great night with a awesome and captive audience.

I presented this talk this past Tuesday (7/21/15) at the San Francisco at General Assembly campus to a group of 18 UX Design students and feel very lucky for the opportunity to talk about something I think and care so much about.  Here are a few of the highlights and the slide deck for the talk.


> Highlights
>
>   1.  A (very) short history of the human-computer interface
>   2.  Designing the Internet of Things is gonna be fun
>   3.  Wearable interfaces are here (to stay)
>   4.  Ubiquitous and calm computers are a must

Got some insanely warm feedback from the students after the talk. It was great to see them energized and curious about the future. Cynicism is poision for progress, any opportunity to spread and share a sense of wonder is magical.

It ended up on the slideshare homepage the next day and received thousands of views and hundreds of likes and downloads. It was a humbling experience to say the least.

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>

<p>I am grateful to have Matthew Purdon help me edit this talk and give me the opportunity to present it as I have always been passionate about the future and IoT as I see it's place in the future of and don't always get to work on it and rarely have such a bright and captive audience as this.</p>
