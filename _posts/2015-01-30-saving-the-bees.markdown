"Saving the bees" is a short documentary by Brian Dawson about the effect of the California drought on the honey bees.

I wanted to get familiar with the MapBox toolchain and as a new resident of California build a map that scratch my own curiosity about the extent of the drought.

And report on a real-world problem to illustrate the issue.

At about (:timestamp:) the farmer mention "Soil moisture" so i decided to take a look at that and map it across cali to see how bad that had gotten. Over time slider.

Look at the soil density and tell me wtf is happening - why is this so bad? What is it going to affect?
