		In 2010, there was a flood of innovation happening all around us. But we started with a fundamental question:
		<span class="bold">Can technology make people's lives better? Can it make life easier?</span>

		<p>
		Isaac and I started creating toys and videos as roommates at Syracuse University. We both were creatives and engineers, with a similar love of making. We saw ourselves as 'tinkerers' in a world that was taking itself too seriously. Functional and useful was obvious, we wanted to make products that were fun. We never took off until Chris Becker, a brilliant engineer joined us. His brilliance, creativity and openness combined with our imagine of a better future created a sense of optimism. We set out to answer those fundamental questions with every project we took on. </p>

		We started experimenting with the intersection of the physical and digital world. A few of our first creations included: the first twitter drinking game "<a href="https://thenextweb.com/shareables/2012/02/09/check-out-this-drinking-game-for-twitter-its-called-drinkup/">#DrinkUp</a>" and a "Here on Instagram" wall installation. Other experiments included: a connected <a href="https://twitter.com/LittleTinkerCo/status/216208478254022657">RedBull dispenser</a>, a Tweeting laundry machine, a Spotify alarm clock and <a href="http://littletinker.io/projects/">others</a>.

		 <p>One client, <a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/research/research-centers/nexis/">NEXIS</a>, a research lab was doing cutting-edge experiments with social media at the time, but their space looked like any other lab on campus. So we made them a Foursquare Check-in Gumball Rocket.</p>
