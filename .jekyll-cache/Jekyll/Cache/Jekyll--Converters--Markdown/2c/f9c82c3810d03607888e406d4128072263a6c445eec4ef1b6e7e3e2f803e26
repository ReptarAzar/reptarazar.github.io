        Social media is full of noise. It is really hard to find or host conversations that pertain to one's interests.

        <p>Product strategy: We want Trove to be the place where people can invite and host civil conversations about the news they care about.</p>

        <p>Conversations, fresh perspectives and alternate viewpoints, are one of the paramount differences between print and the web. It's more than a two way flow of information, it's civility and a community that's required for openness and progress. That's what we are striving to build on the Trove platform. We want Trove to be <i>the</i> place on the web to talk about the news. For curators we want to make tools for them to start the conversation, to set the tone, and to host the conversation with a variety of moderation tools. For followers, we are striving for smart engagement.</p>
        <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúTrove aspires to be be a community around the news, however, evidence of community is extremely limited in the existing app. To have true community, there needs to be an ecosystem of interactions that compel curators and users to share and come back into to the app. The lifeblood of conversations is the network of the hooks and invitations that happen outside of the app but bring users back in to participate.‚Äù

        Conversations are not an new construct on the web. Former colleague and creator of SlashDot, Rob Malda (aka Cmdr Taco), was instramental in forming opinions about what makes for a good (and bad) environment for discussion. No one understands the ugliness that can come from an unfettered community quite like he does. We wanted to seed a very different moderated and context rich experience on Trove.

        <p>When doing research, I started looking for tight, civilized communities. I found that the more transparent and the more niche the context, the better behaved the mob was. I then used these findings to inform design decisions and they helpd product folks decide who to reach out to for the first wave.

        <p>Branch - Discussions only platform, a back-and-forth style UI starting with a single article post (since been shutdown)- created by the genius @Ev and was sold to fb. Branch Product Lead now works for the white house as the first head of product.</p>

        <p>Swarm - Less similar but, people talking to their friends about where they are and where they're going - @dens has been a personal inspiration and has a ton of experience with tips and online communication
        Letterboxed - a film diary website with a tight community of cinaphiles - excellent at creating hooks back into the product. Keep the flow going and films have longer halflife than most articles but is similar to some of the featured news on Trove.</p>

        I always start with lists of ideas because they are the fastest way to get ideas out. At the beginning of every project, there's a flood and if I  don't get them down, they're gone. Next is a bunch of thumbnails of flows that I'm working out in my head. These thumbails are also the first time I can show other designers and PMs what I'm thinking and get feedback after only a few minutes. If I have a complete flow between products (web, email, native) it's a great way to all get on the same page before blowing out full wireframes.

        <p>In general my sketches are low-fidelity and include no visual design. I'm simply trying to illustrate interactions and information architecture. Getting the flow and the general hierarchy down is most important in this phase. Soft pencils and a regular black sharpie to paper work really well for me in this phase.</p>

        The secret sauce, the glue between product and design and engineering, the great focuser: wireframes. I've honed wireframes so now I have my own style. I use bold lines, black and white wireframes that use proportion, line and figre-ground to illustrate the communication, so that everyone (including me) can go nose first into the wall and focus on the hare interactions and flows that will result on the right experience we want to create and save teh visual design, colors and polish for later. This is where engineering is more involved as well.

        <p>Starting with mobile, I'll start with the key interactions and the flesh out the others  For this project, there was a different experience we wanted for the curator (that's starting and hosting the conversations) and the follower that's getting involved later.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I'll throw these wireframes into a keynote so they can animate together a tiny bit so they will feel alive and get people excited about what we're building. I'm easily excitable and galvanizing a team, espcially as new people and engineers are introduced to the concept, is important.</p>

        <p>Then I'll revise and return for another presentation. 6-8 presentations in a 10 day period is common. I don't take too many meetings during these sprints and am very head down sketching and creating more wireframes. Miranda, a Senior PM, and I will typically have 1:1s daily to work out the kinks and get the ideas/feedback cleaner for me to respond to.</p>


        <p>Below is the slides from keynote presentation I gave to the product and engineering teams while we were trying to nail down the key flows. It covers a persona, the email hook for a curator, the flow to trove.com, and the follower flow that closes the feedback loop.</p>
