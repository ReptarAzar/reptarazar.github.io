    <p>Previously at Adobe, I was the design lead for Acrobat. For two years, I helped reimagine the platform for the web and made several billion PDFs accessible with computer vision.</p>  
      
    <p>Previously, I was a product designer at the Washington Post Innovation Lab and co-founded  Little Tinker a software and hardware art things company. </p>
    
    <p>My leadership style is of a service leader, and I take a lot of pleasure from teaching. I have experience teaching web design and coding at Syracuse University as well as being a UX instructor at General Assembly in San Francisco, CA.</p>
      
    <p>I’m also a passionate road, track, trail, and ultra runner. With 12 marathons, a 3x Boston Qualifier, and a personal best of 2:41 at the 2024 London Marahon, my goals include completing all six major marathons (four remaining, two planned for 2024), finishing a marathon in under 2:30, and running into my 80s. </p>
      
    <p>In addition to participating in races and learning about myself, I enjoy giving back to the sport as a certified coach in Jack Daniel’s Distance Training, a designer of VDOT, a platform for  runners and coaches, and a volunteer race videographer as a follow cam operator.</p>   
      
    <p>I’m an active member of the Brooklyn Track Club and can be found at the San Francisco Running Company group runs. </p>  
      
    <p>I’m an active member of a Zen Buddhist sangha in the Lâm Te Dyana School (Linji) lineage in the Plum Village tradition. My dharma name is <span class="italicized">Steadfast Bodhisattva of the Source</span> and I’m deeply interested in the mind-body connection and its relationship to inner peace and various states of consciousness.</p>
      
    <p>I was born and raised in Bristol, Rhode Island to Julianne M McCarthy and Dr. James A Azar, a hardware technician and developmental psychologist. I have one sister, Dr. Margaret Azar, who is a child psychologist and faculty member at Brown University in Providence, RI.</p>
