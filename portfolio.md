	<div class="process">
		<p>In all of these projects, there is a similar process.</p>

		    <div class="process-list">
		        <p><b>Sketching sessions</b> - I believe the more cross-discipline teams are the better when it comes to finding problem areas and opportunities. I believe having different perspectives upfront makes for better, more informed products. I believe all people can be creative from stakeholders and decision makers, data scientists, back-end and front-end engineers, to business developers, clients, and UX researchers. There is no monopoly on ideas or one source of opportunity.</p>

		        <p><b>Define and profile your user</b> - Usually requires market research. Your sales, tech success and business development teams will be really helpful here. What are their habits? What are they using now to solve their problems? What is their buying power and cash on hand? Who are examples of this archetype? </p>

		        <p><b>Research, test prototypes with real users</b> - I believe in fast prototypes to test product ideas with real customers. </p>

		        <p><b>Write up requirements with product managers</b> - I believe the best requirements docs include design and that you never know the scope of the project without designs. </p>

		        <p><b>Information architecture</b> - I believe that defining and diagramming the parts leads to stronger more stable product architecture. Ontology (what are the pieces?), taxonomy (what is the order?), choreography (how do they interact?) is a great way to get alignment and hash out unforeseen problems.</p>

		        <p><b>Wireframes</b> - Great tool for communication and dually helpful leading documents for engineers tasked with writing models and defining API endpoints. Focuses the team on features and functionality, puts a hold visual design discussions. Also answers “what data needs to be available where?”</p>

		        <p><b>Finally, visual design and implementation and iteration</b> - As an in-house designer I believe in maintaining component libraries and collaborative style guides. It’s the best way to scale design as a team and product suite grows. </p>

		    </div>

		<p>This process is similar to a lot of Product Designers and software shops. One unique facet that is my point of view that new poducts find market fit better, faster and more consistently when they “pave worn paths.” I think designers and products that first look, listen, inquire a lot while looking for pain points and ad-hoc solutions before designing. While it is possible to create successful products with intuition, I think it is more reliable to use research to find the latent needs of customers.</p>

		<p>So that is a bit about my process and how the sausage is made. Thanks for being here and I hope you enjoy the case studies above.</p>
