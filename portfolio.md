<p>In all of these projects, you will see a trend, a process.</p>

<p>You may find it boring, or repetitive, or a bit like your classic elementary school scientific method. But t works. There's a lot of nuance to a good process but here's how I've learned to produce the best, most useful work I know how. Here goes:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Figure out and define the problem for the business and users</li>
        <li>Analyze it and figure out the best way(s) to solve it and sketch those out</li>
        <li>Continue to flesh those ideas out until everyone is on the same page and we figure out what we're gonna build</li>
        <li>Mock up, build, and test</li>
        <li>Analyze how it went and start all over when we decide there's a problem again.</li>
    </ol>

<p>The process is only slightly different for personal projects â€“ there is no business, so we can focus on building that focuses on just the user problems and experience.</p>

<p>So that is the "process" I hope you enjoy the case studies to see what decisions get made where and why.</p>
